LocalTraders aims to bring P2P transactions to the LATAM market, which they feel is often shut out of the global crypto market due to language barriers, communication issues, no legal support and inadequate tax solutions. The public sale of LCT aims to create a thriving community to interact and grow with the platform as well as the initial liquidity for trading on the platform",

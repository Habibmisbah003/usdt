    "description": "Claz Token ( CLAZ ) is a smart contract on the BNB smart chain network. It can be used to send or receive payments almost instantly from anywhere in the world. The transaction costs are very low and makes it unique to use CLAZ on a day to day basis. This makes a big difference since compared to POW it requires the miners to validate the transactions and makes them expensive and slow and even more when the network is congested. We are committed to actively engage with our community and actually bring real use of this token, so that together united as a community CLAZ can be used in telegram through bots like airdrops, investment purposes, bots that gives tasks in exchange of tokens, giveaways for voting to most of the things used in Telegram.",

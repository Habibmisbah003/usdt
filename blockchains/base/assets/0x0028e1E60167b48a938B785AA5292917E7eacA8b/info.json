  "description": "Coinye West is a revival of one of the original crypto memes. In 2014, Coinye West was launched as its own chain and memecoin, well before ERC20s existed. It was one of the first memecoins in existence, right behind DOGE. However, Kanye and his lawyers went after the founders and sued them to shut it down.  We believe in unstoppable networks and thatâ€™s why we have relaunched $COINYE. The memecoin that should have been 10 years ago can now live forever, on Base.  Do you like fish sticks?",

    "short_description": "StaFi is the first decentralized protocol unlocking liquidity of staked assets. FIS is the native coin of the network.",
    "description": "The protocol of StaFi is created by Substrate and adopts Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS), which completes Staking by setting up Staking Contracts in the upper layer to communicate with public chains. The Staking process is immune to StaFiâ€™s contracts, for the latter act as the account book during Staking. Tokens staked through contracts will be written in the contracts and finally be locked-up on the original chain.",

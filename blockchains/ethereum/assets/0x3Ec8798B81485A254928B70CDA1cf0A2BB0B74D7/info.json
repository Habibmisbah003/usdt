    "description": "Gro DAO token is the governance token of Gro Protocol, which is a stablecoin yield aggregator providing leveraged yields & protected savings through risk-tranching. \n\nThe token is launched through a Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool that was completed on 1st October 2021; the total tokenholders are higher than what is shown on the contract since we have multiple staking pools (GRO/ETH, GRO/USDC, etc) to increase liquidity of the token on decentralised exchange.",

  "description": "The Kapital DAO is the leading provider of web3 gaming asset management tech, with top brands like Yield Guild Games (YGG) and others already using the platform to scale. The platform features key innovations around \"hierarchical delegation\" that enable multiple layers of institutional control in which admins own assets and delegate to managers, who then subdelegate to players â€“ this framework is unique to our protocol, and does not readily exist elsewhere in the space.",

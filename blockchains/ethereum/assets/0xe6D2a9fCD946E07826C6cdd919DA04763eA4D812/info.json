    "description": "Created by a 12-year-old aspiring to help people in poverty, Bruh is a crypto for the people. Bruh plans to give back to the poor via fundraisers and tokens. The fundraisers will raise fiat and crypto to help people in poverty around the world. Organizations helping people in poverty will also get half of all Bruh minted via asset sales. With the sales and fundraisers, there are also NFTs on Artion and OpenSea that represent people in poverty.",

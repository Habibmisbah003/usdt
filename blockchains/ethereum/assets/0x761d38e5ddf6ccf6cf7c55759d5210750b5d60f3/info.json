{Dear Earth Citizens,

As you may know, I have dedicated my life to ensuring that humanity becomes a multi-planetary species. This involves work on four front: interplanetary flight, terraforming the planet, sending settlers, and creating an interplanetary currency. I am excited to announce today the launch of our forefront in our mission to Mars. The first interplanetary currency: Dogelon.

Technically, it is is a fork of Dogecoin, in the same sense that a knife is a fork of a spoon. I have named it after the capital city of Mars: Dogelon (pronounced Dog-a-lon, not Doge Elon because that would be arrogant). The ticker is Dogelon (ELON), which should help prevent any confusion. I am launching this currency today, in anticipation of bringing the first settlers to Mars, for a very specific reason: To help people take the trip with me. A lot of good people have hopes of one day reaching the Moon.

In my opinion, of course, this is a very low aspiration. We want to reach Mars and beyond. However, many of those good people are rugged, or buy scam tokens that can't be sold. For this reason, the Dogelon community pledges to send tokens over time to victims of rugs and scams, so that the worst day of their trading life can be turned into their best. And after some time, they will be able to join us on our regular flights to Mars....}

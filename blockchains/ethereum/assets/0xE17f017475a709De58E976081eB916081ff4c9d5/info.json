  "description": "RMPL is a cryptocurrency with an elastic supply model. This means that the total supply of RMPL is constantly changing. RMLP reaches a supply-price equilibrium with its randomized rebasing. As a result, the volatility is in the token supply, not the price. A holderâ€™s ownership of the network always remains the same, as wallet balances are globally altered in proportion to changes in demand.",

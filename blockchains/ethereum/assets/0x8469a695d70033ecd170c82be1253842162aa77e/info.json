    "description": "Resources will be released using a model of attenuation supply with random factors. Resource release will be determined by the Land's attributes (the five resources' release rate) and the player's mining indicators. The initial maximum rate of resource generation at the Land's birth is the full resources you can mine daily. This rate decays by 1/10,000 every day",

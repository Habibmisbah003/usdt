    "description": "Popcorn is a new paradigm for DeFi where yield-generating products simultaneously fund nonprofit and social impact beneficiaries at no additional cost to the user. These beneficiaries are nonprofits, charities, and grassroot projects working in the areas of environment, education, open source, and inequality. Members of the PopcornDAO (POP token holders) are eligible to participate in all aspects of DAO governance, including beneficiary nominations and grant elections. They determine which beneficiaries receive a percentage of earned protocol fees on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis, and are incentivized to do so with POP rewards.\n",

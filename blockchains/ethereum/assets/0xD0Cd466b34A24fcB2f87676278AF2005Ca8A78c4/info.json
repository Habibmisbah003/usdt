    "description": "Popcorn is aiding a revolutionary shift in global systems through accessible DeFi products that align financial wellbeing with positive global impact.\n\nPopcorn simplifies yield-generating strategies with an easy-to-use interface that benefits not only end users, but local and global communities alike. This is because Popcorn strategies generate high yield and at the same time they fund community selected social impact and non-profit organizations without any extra costs to the end user. Token holders are able to direct protocol revenue directly to non-profits through a decentralized governance mechanism. Through this mechanism, Popcorn represents a new paradigm for decentralized finance where yield-generating products simultaneously contribute to social impact.\n\nAudits:\nhttps://www.zokyo.io/audit-reports?2ebcbc23_page=3\nhttps://assets.website-files.com/5f99eb79d508ca853be5f2e8/61b21474b7a1746d889f599d_Popcorn%20SC%20Audit.pdf\n\nImmunefi Bug Bounty Program: https://immunefi.com/bounty/popcornnetwork/",

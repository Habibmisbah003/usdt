    "description": "WoWMaX is the next generation DEX aggregation protocol that uses slippage as an additional source of optimization. Large swaps of native tokens (ETH, BNB, AVAX, MATIC) cause their slippage, creating price difference for all other coins, including BTC, traded to both native tokens and stablecoins. WoWMaX moves those coins between DEX pools, extracting arbitrage profit, and gives it back to traders.",

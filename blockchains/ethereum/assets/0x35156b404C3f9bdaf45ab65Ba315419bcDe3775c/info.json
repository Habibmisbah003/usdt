  "description": "Chihiro Inu is a modern take on P2E gaming, changing the ways games attract and benefit the players. Our solution is to give players more control over the game development paths and allow players to gain ownership over assets gained through gameplay. This is accomplised by decentralizing the decision making by taking advantage of Chihiro Inu’s in-house developed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and by the wide usage of blockchain technology such as non-fungible tokens (NFT’s).",

    "description": "DefyDefi is a next-gen auto-yield smart contract that is designed to serve real-world use cases. Their vision is to have the market cap associated with its NFT treasury, royalties, and influencer partnerships. They envision that their NFT assets and partnerships have a more long-term value compared to creating another "technology-focused" token in the market. The long-term sustainability of the project is to generate income from its NFT royalties rather than just relying on price speculation.",

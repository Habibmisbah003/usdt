    "description": "Sable Token (SBL) is a deflationary charity token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network that was created as a means to generate wealth for the purpose of providing assistance and support to missions-based humanitarian projects throughout the world. Our project is purely grassroots and we believe strongly in collaborating with other projects along our journey in order to grow stronger as a community, and to also share knowledge about what we learn with others who are interested in learning about how to start or grow their own projects.

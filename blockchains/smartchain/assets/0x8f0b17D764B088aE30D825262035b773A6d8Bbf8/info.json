    "description": "The birth of DAMU coin is attributed to the idea of motivating crypto beginners to do well in this arena. DAMU is a hyper-deflationary coin, built on the Binance Smart Chain whose primary goal is to make a major impact in the world by making donations to various humanitarian and socio-economic causes, while allowing the average person to leverage their strength in community numbers to make a positive impact. DAMU has static reflections built into it, which means more DAMU coins are added to each holderâ€™s wallet with every transaction in an ever-decreasing supply.",

    "description": "MuskX benefits directly from the rocket landing success rate achieved by Elon Musk and SpaceX. Starship landings equate to a 3% burn of the remaining landing burn contract, while Falcon 9 landings prompt a 2% burn. Airdrop claims also result in a 1:1 1% burn of the remaining airdrop burn pool.

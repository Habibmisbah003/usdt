It means that we will develop a lot of products but all the products will use the same token which is BitV. By investing in Bitvalley you invest in all of these projects. How will we start to build this ecosystem? Well, we already have. We have our first and second product already developed which are Bitdash and NFT Marketplace, also our third platform Bitvalley Mobile App (Which is our main product) is already in progress and it will have multiple products inside..",

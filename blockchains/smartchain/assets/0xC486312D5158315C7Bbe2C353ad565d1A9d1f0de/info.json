    "description": "Yang is one of the 2 tokens in the YinYang Reflect system. Both tokens, Yin & Yang, are forever intertwined via Buying, TRUE burning, and reflecting in each other as well as 2 secondary Blue Chip tokens, BTCB & BNB. The True Burn mechanism causes the Total supply of both tokens to actually decrease on chain. Holders can internally stake the native tokens on the projects website dAPP to receive bonus multipliers to their normal Reflections rate & Stakers have the option to claim rewards early, before contract distribution and may also choose BUSD as a rewards claiming option.",

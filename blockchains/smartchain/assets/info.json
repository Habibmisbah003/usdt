    "description": "Inflation Hedging Coin (IHC) is not another speculative cryptocurrency without any solutions or backing. IHC burns itself from its total market capitalization annually at the US inflation rate to store value â€” and will continue to do so until its total market capitalization is equal to the number of tokens the total number of token holders hold. (Store of Value Concept) IHC will incur a high transaction fee of 5%. Fees will accumulate and get redistributed to all token holders regularly, excluding the founders and their team. The high transaction fee incentivizes the token holders to save their tokens instead of trading them, bringing price stability in this volatile space of crypto-currency. Through our on-chain wallet application, IHC token holders will receive financial services, such as lending and yield-farming their tokens.",

    "description": "SAFE was initiated by the SAFE Foundation in Singapore in October 2014, focusing on privacy protection and secure payment, importing cross-chain assets, creating the SafeSwap transaction field, and expanding more commercial applications, aiming to build a global privacy protection ecosystem. It has a history of 8 years. During this period, it has gone through three major iterations of Safe1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and now version 4.0 has been launched and is being tested.",

    "description": "SafePalestine is our charity token; we aim to do more than simply raise awareness for the plight of the Palestinian people, we will use our platform to generate vital donations to registered charities, operating in the heart of Palestine. Our method is simple, two per cent of each transaction will be sent directly to a charity wallet. The more SafePalestine is purchased, the more vital funds weâ€™ll be able to raise, benefitting holders and our charitable partners alike.
Expect to see exciting future developments, Including NFT auctions of original Palestinian art, and an upcoming charity lottery to win airdrops of SafePalestine tokens",

    "description": "KAPEX is a native utility token of SummitSwap with a mechanism of keeping stable purchasing power (SPP). KAPEX emission is multi-collateralized by digital assets and economics of the SummitBC Ecosystem. We believe in the evolution of the financial system based around the creation of a decentralized digital asset with a stable value pegged to real purchasing power. The evolution of KAPEX is strongly related to the development of the SummitBC Ecosystem.",

    "description": "KAPEX is a native utility token of SummitSwap with a mechanism of keeping stable purchasing power (SPP). KAPEX emission is multi-collateralized by digital assets and economics of the SummitBC Ecosystem. We believe in the evolution of the financial system based around the creation of a decentralized digital asset with a stable value pegged to real purchasing power. An asset with stable purchasing power is naturally suitable as a payment asset and a money savings instrument at the same time. There is no way to create an asset with stable purchasing power from scratch therefore initially KAPEX is expected to be fairly volatile. KAPEX development is divided into iterations. Starting from a hyper-volatile asset in its first iteration, KAPEX will eventually become an asset with stable purchasing power. The evolution of KAPEX is strongly related to the development of the SummitBC Ecosystem.",

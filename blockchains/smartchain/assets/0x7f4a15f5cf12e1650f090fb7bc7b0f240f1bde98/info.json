	"description": "$GREATAPE is a BEP20 token built on Binance Smart Chain by the one and only creator of the Reflect function that has been used thousands of times and by multi-billion dollar protocols such as SAFEMOON and FEG. Morpheus released the Reflect code to the public and it has taken over the Crypto market almost entirely. This is the new era of rebase. The token is a fully decentralized protocol that has improved upon Safemoon's code by fixing the security flaws and reducing gas costs by up to 70%. It was stealth launched with a limit of 100m tokens per TX to prevent whale manipulation. Ownership was renounced before launch and the contract launch method was called by the community after 40 BNB was sent to the contract address for liquidity.",

    "description": "Ryoshi is a deflationary, fan  driven meme token that came to take over the meme game. With 10% burn from every transaction that  decreases the supply and increases the demand you can kick back and watch your Ryo$hi investment grow. To ensure a fair distribuition we have decided to burn 50% of the total supply.  The remaining 42% of the supply is currentyly serving a life sentence at PancakeSwap correctional facility and is never getting out.",

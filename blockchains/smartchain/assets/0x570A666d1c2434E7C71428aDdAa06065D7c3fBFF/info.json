    "description": "KRAA Coin (KRAA) is a decentralized Bird meme token ecosystem fueled by the KRAA token. A meme coin or meme token is a cryptocurrency that is inspired by a meme or an internet joke. As the internet joke goes viral, the value of the associated meme coin goes up as people tend to become a member of that sensational internet joke. Even though the team at KRAA takes the lead on development, it acts as a decentralized autonomous organization. KRAA is thus a community-driven cryptocurrency.",

    CorsoCoin looks to establish a dominant position in the market. There is nothing special about this token except for the hope of the developer in his peers.
    Since the division of jobs in the tribal society many have been the faces of a token. People have been swapping fish for eggs, jewellery for freedom in times of war and jewellery for love in all times. We live a new era.
     Inspired by the Cane Corso breed out of Italy I am bringing to you one more deflationary coin with a very determined master.
     
     Be patient with me. I'm a takeaway driver not a scamer.

    "description": "Beer Token is a new deflationary currency with a 4% tax on all transactions. We have partnered with numerous breweries to create our own brand of beer which can be bought only through our currency. We also have plans to be implemented into bars, restaurants, festivals etc. This makes us superior to other new tokens because we actually have a real world use case which keeps the coin in heavy circulation and also keeps holders earning from the burn/redistribution.",

    "description": "Lever is an open-source margin trading platform where you can lend, borrow and perform leveraged trading to either buy long/sell short an asset in just one place. For lenders and/or borrowers, you can lend your idle crypto assets (including your deposit certificates from other lending protocols) to earn interest or use them as collateral to take out loans. And for traders, after making a margin deposit in the margin pool, you will be able to open either long or short positions in a supported asset in Lever with up to 3x leverage. The platform makes use of external AMMs like Uniswap to provide surplus liquidity for margin traders to open positions of any size.",

    "description":  "Call of Cheems is a GameFi token dedicated to hosting online FPS gaming tournaments for crypto prize pools. The project is dedicated to bridging crypto and competitive gaming in a way that allows players to win crypto currency rather than fiat, which is a game-changer for people who are interested in alternative forms of payment in the FPS competitive gaming industry. To participate in these tournaments, holders of the token who want to compete must submit an application form to verify that they are token holders to ultimately participate in the gaming events Call of Cheems are hosting. This allows the project to keep funding future gaming tournaments to sustain its longevity. Call of Cheems is a gamer-oriented community that gives their investors the voice to vote on what kind of events they want to watch and/or participate in, and what direction they want to see the project grow based on the communitys feedback.",

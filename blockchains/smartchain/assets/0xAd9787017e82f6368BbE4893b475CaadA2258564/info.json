Therefore, we also rely on BITCOIN to create the current euphoria of the market but with new sophistication and much more complete protocols and features.\n\nWe combine bitcoin with the current developments, namely protocol, Defi, swap and NFT. thus, BTA is an asset that deserves to be valued the higher in the future and is worthy of long-term storage like bitcoin.",

    "description": "MOON is a native token of HoneyFarm Layer 3 - HoneyMoon\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nbelow is not a description but explanation of the situation.\nPlease read below before closing this pull request.\nHello @cryptomanz ,\n\nNice to e-meet you again.\n\nMOON is a native token of HoneyFarm's layer 3 - HoneyMoon. (https://moon.honeyfarm.finance)\nIt's already listed on Coingecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/honeymoon-token) and CoinMarketCap (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/honeymoon-finance/).\nAnd it has already $17.82M of 5 days trade volume on PancakeSwap (https://pancakeswap.finance/info/token/0xe8c93310af068aa50bd7bf0ebfa459df2a02ceba)\nimage\n\nAnd like as the other DeFi tokens, most of the tokens are held in our masterchef contract/LP contract.\nAll Top 10 holders are contracts due to the nature of the DeFi token.\n(https://bscscan.com/token/0xE8c93310af068aa50bd7bF0ebFa459Df2a02ceba#balances)\nimage\n\nIt's actually same situation as HONEY (#12886\n(#12889) tokens, which are already registered.\n\nIt has been transfered 131K times just in 5 days, which means there are lots of users trading/holding this but they're just staking them in our farm.\n\nPlease understand this situation and register MOON token to TWT.\nAnd I actually already paid for my previous pull request you closed.\nTxID CF48D69808CBED2CF21D3347B141EB484D6051D2FB2B6C54507A533EC4D7853A\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if you let me know what to do about it\n\nThanks!",

Together with two other non-profit organizations, we have launched a project that should provide more opportunities for organizations such as ours to raise funds for their activities. We are currently in test mode and we need your help to run it. Given the incredible tragedy that is happening in Ukraine today, please make an exception to the rules for our project and process our request.",

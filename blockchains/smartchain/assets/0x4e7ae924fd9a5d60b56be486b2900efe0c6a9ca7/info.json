    "description": "The Lottery Token is the first Lotto related Token on the Binance Smart Chain. It features an automated and integrated Lottery in the contract itself. The Lotterypool is filled with 2% of the 6% fee per transaction, the other 2% get instantly redistributed among all holders and the other 2% are burned. The frequency of the lottery is based on the traffic and triggers after reaching 0.1% of the current total supply. Holders don't need to buy tickets, holding a minimal amount results in a lifetime participation. This minimal amount will be changed over the time depending on the current price of LOT to still be affordable for everyone. The goal is to create a fair Lottery for anyone involved.",

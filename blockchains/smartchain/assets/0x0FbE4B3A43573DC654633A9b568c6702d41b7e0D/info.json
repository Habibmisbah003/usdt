    "description": "The BLOB FINANCE smart contract applies a 4% fee on all transactions (buys/sells). Out of \nthis, 2% is automatically distributed to holders, without farming! This means the \namount of tokens in your wallet will forever increase as people transact. In addition, the BLOB TOKEN smart contract also takes 2% of each transaction and \nautomatically adds it to the liquidity pool. The liquidity pool will continuously increase,\nwhich leads to a higher price floor.",

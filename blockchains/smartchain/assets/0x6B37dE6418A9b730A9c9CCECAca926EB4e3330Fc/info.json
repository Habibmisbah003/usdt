    "description": "Solac Token is a deflationary token that allows for passive income generation for investors. Hereâ€™s how it works. 5% on each transaction is split instantly among token holders and the burn wallet, reducing supply and rewarding holders. The Solac Token protocol will burn 3% of every transaction forever and redistribute the remaining 2% to token holders as reward. This arrangement eradicates 3rd party risk from having to keep assets in a separate contract while yield farming while reducing supply.",

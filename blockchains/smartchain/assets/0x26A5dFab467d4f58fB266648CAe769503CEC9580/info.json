    "description": "Benchmark Protocol mitigates liquidation events and hedges risk with the MARK token; a supply elastic, stablecoin-alternative that connects traditional capital markets to DeFi. The protocol operates as a rules-based utility that dynamically adjusts supply based on the CBOE volatility index (VIX) and deviations from the target metric - equal to 1 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) unit. The Standard token (xMARK) represents a share of MARK that is deposited in a token pool that is affected by rebasements, while xMARK itself is unaffected by rebasements.",

    "description": "WHAT IS DMASK? The Mask (DMASK) token is a DeFi Crypto Currency made on Binance smart chain with a deflationary supply and an automated redistribution mechanism that rewards holders. DMASK was launched on November 23, 2021, with a total supply of 20,000,000,000 DMASK. DMASK works by applying a 5% tax to each transaction. This tax is used as follows - 1% is instantly distributed to the holders of DMASK - 1% is burned to reduce the supply - 1% is sent to DMASK's lottery wallet (DMASKLottery) - 1% is sent to DMASK's gaming wallet for P2E gaming rewards. - 1% is used for marketing to help the project grow",

    "description": "X2P (a BSC project) is a frictionless, high-yield, deflationary & decentralized token on the Binance Smart Chain. A 10% transaction fee will be distributed over all X2P holders every time there's a transaction & 5% will go to the Liquidity Pool. Our goal is to motivate people by holding their coins and maximize their profits by doing this. Our system is built so it fits holders and demotivates quick profit (scalping etc.) because of the total 15% transaction fee. Our Tokenomics are designed to be a passive way of staking to long term investors since their tokens will increase with every transaction. Stay with us for the long ride!",

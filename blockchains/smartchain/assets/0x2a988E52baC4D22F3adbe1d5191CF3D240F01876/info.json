    "description": "ASSARA token launched on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP20). It is fully decentralized. Ownership was renounced at launch and all communications, developments, and marketing campaigns are planned and performed by members of the Community. We followed this path so that everyone has to buy on the open market, ensuring a fair and complete distribution where Devs donâ€™t own team tokens they can dump on the community. With the help of the Programmers and the Crypto Experts, we have been able to implement Decentralized Smart Contract-based applications that make the whole ASSARA community win.",

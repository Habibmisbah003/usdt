    "description": "We will integrate our amethyst stone into all metaverse games with a special software. When an individual wants to buy a land and excavate in the metaverse, he will be able to become rich when he reaches the mine, as in the real world. We get support from blockchain networks for this software. Until this software is finished, our community will grow every day and value our amethyst stone.\n\n \n\nA project whitepaper is a team's vision and blueprint for where the project is going. The more creative and well-written a whitepaper, the better the vision. Check ours and see if we got it right. More to come.",

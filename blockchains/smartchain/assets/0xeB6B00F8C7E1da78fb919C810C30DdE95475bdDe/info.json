    "description": "Bitcoin mining has become increasingly centralized and harmful to the environment with scale. It has also lost touch with the ethos of its creator Satoshi. $MINERS is here to change that, by creating the first decentralized community for carbon neutral Bitcoin mining. We are challenging the status quo and ensuring everyone has equal access to mining and the profits that come with it.",

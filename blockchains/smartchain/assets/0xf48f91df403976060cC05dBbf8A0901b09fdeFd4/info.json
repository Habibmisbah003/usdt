With its own decentralized app, Minu is giving an 8% daily return to its miners in forms of BNB, while Minu's native token is constantly increasing the TVL (Total Value Locked) of its miner with a 2% of every transaction (buy or sell) going to contract of the miner. Only Minu holders have the ability to start mining and earn daily rewards.",

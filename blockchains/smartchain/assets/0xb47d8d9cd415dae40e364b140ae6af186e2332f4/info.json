    "description": "Swift Moon combines the Rebasing concept, Auto Liquidity Generation whilst also integrating the big brained RFI tech by taking a 8% fee on every transaction. That fee is broken up into 3 parts. Reflection — 2% of the fee is distributed to every wallet that holds $SMOON on a percentage basis. The more $SMOON you hold the more tokens you will receive, LP Generation — 3% of the fee (1.5% of the transaction) collected in $SMOON is sold into BNB. That BNB is married up with the remaining 1.5% of $SMOON and deposited back into the Pancakeswap liquidity pool and finally 2% is sent to the 0x00dead address which is burnt forever thereby ultimately decreasing supply.",

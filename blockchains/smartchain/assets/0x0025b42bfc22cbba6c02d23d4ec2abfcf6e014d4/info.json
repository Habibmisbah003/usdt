    "description": "Sheep Token is a deflationary token that allows for passive income generation for investors. The first juicy feature is the “penalty” applied to all buy/sell/wallet transfer transactions. This penalty increases the liquidity, reduces the supply and rewards token holders. Here’s how it works. 6% on each transaction is split instantly among token holders and the burn wallet, reducing supply and rewarding holders. The Sheep Token protocol will burn 3% of every transaction forever and redistribute the remaining 3% to token holders as reward. This arrangement eradicates 3rd party risk from having to keep assets in a separate contract while yield farming while reducing supply and rewarding holders with passive wealth generation.",

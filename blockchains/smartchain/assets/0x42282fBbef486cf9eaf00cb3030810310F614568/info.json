    "description": "Moonlight is a token on the Binance Smart Chain. We want to provide a comprehensive set of analytical tools on the BSC network. Holding Moonlight tokens will be required to have access to these tools.\n\nOur first tool isÂ Poocoin Promotion Alert (PPA)- a bot that send an alert to Moonlight holders as soon as a new coin gets promoted on Poocoin. The returns of this bot so far have been amazing (+200% on average).\n\nOur website is live and our PPA tool just needs some testing before mass deployment.",

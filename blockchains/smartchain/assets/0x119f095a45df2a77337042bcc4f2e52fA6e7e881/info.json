    "description": "The biggest difference between Super Minesweeper and Microsoft Minesweeper is that each map is created by the player, not randomly generated by the system. Players create a unique game map, upload the map parameters to the Blockchain to obtain NFT credentials, and obtain the game map by referring to the NFT parameters on the chain at the beginning of Minesweeper.\nAlthough the map generation of Super Minesweeper seems unnecessary, its significance lies in the fact that the patterns displayed on the game map are no longer messy and disorderly, but are designed and created by players, perhaps a smiling face pattern, perhaps a blessing text, perhaps a logo, etc. We believe that pictographic game maps can not only be used for game recreation, but also bring more spiritual pleasure.\nMaking NFT requires destroying the corresponding SM token. NFT can be used for games and SM is awarded as a mining reward, so you can also use it as a mining machine and you can trade NFT freely.\nThere is no limit to the number of NFTs, but each pattern is unique, which doomed its scarcity. Players can keep it permanently on the Blockchain and store it in their wallets.",

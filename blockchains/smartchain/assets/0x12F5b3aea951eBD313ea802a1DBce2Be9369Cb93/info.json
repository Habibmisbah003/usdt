    "description": "We present you Peseta token, the token oriented to renewable energy, more specifically to solar energy.\nWhen we think  about renewable energies, wind, hydraulic, tidal, biomass and solar, among others, may come to mind.\nFrom all of them we have decided to take advantage of solar energy. On average, Spain has about 2,500 hours of sunshine per year. This level of sunshine makes our country an ideal place to generate our own clean energy through solar panels.",

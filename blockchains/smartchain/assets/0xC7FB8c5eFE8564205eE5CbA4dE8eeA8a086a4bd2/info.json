    "description": "PocketRocket is a deflationary token that allows for passive income generation for investors. Hereâ€™s how it works. 8% on each transaction is split instantly among token holders, marketing and the burn wallet, reducing supply and rewarding holders. PocketRocket protocol will burn 2% of every transaction forever and redistribute 2% to token holders as reward. This arrangement eradicates 3rd party risk from having to keep assets in a separate contract while yield farming while reducing supply.",

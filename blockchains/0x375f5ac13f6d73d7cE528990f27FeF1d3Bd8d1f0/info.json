    "description": "Platypus Token is a fair launch, community token on the Binance smart chain. That snazzy little thing Platy has right there. We designed Platy with you in mind with modern tokenomic features that include Reflection, LP Acquisition, and Burn. A 10% fee will be applied for sellers, with the 5% of those tokens being redistributed to other Platy holders, so you feel safe in holding on to that precious, precious platy goodness. 45% of the initial supply has also been burned.",

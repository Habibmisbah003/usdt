    "description": "Our token it is a deflationary token, for every transaction we burn 1%, redistribute 1% and we also have a pool for donations where we also keep 1%. At the moment we have 1000+ holders and strong community being built. Over 700 twitter followers and over 500+ telegram members. \n\nWe have a roadmap built until June, for now our token only works as an auto-yield with the mechanics mentioned before. But in the future we are going to be working on more features, the main one is going to be a yield farming system with fair APY.\n\nWe hold a noble cause, which is donating to charity organizations around the globe. At the moment our hope is to create a strong token which will be the base for future charity projects.",

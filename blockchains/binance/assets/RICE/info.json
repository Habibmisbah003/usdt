    "description": "We created Rooster Battle with one sole purpose: To become a fully decentralized PvP game. Every battle in this game will be Player versus Player. Similar to the real cockfighting game, you need to raise your roosters, and fight with other players. There is no PvE, PvG mode in this game. The game is fully decentralized, and we do not have any centralize backend server for the game. Every battle will happen on blockchain, and the game logic is open source.",

    "description": "Rexchange stands for Reciprocity Exchange, a short form to denote the notion of exchanging reciprocal currency values. We started working to development of this project since 2019 and in 2021 we launched Rexchange App to issue Reciprocity Bonds for the research and development of Rexchange (RXNG) token in a blockchain technology. Eventually, in January 13th of 2023, we came up with working proof of Rexchange (RXNG) with a decision to deploy as ERC20 token with Polygon network with a limited supply of 5000 RXNG. ",

    "description": "RAIN Coin is an automated meme coin where 1% of all transactions (buys, sells, & transfers) are redistributed back to all other holders. Plus, every day at midnight UTC there is a large THUNDERSTORM that gives all wallets bonus coins, even those in cold storage. With no team, no treasury, and no expenses, RAIN has no built-in selling pressure.",

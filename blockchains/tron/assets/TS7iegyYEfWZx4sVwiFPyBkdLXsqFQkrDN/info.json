    "description": "By using blockchain technology we are creating a platform that will enable everyone to benefit from real estate opportunities in distress market. It will act as a transactional hub between a fund and the SBG (SwissBurg) token holders themselves who will benefit through the increasing value of SBG token. Twinned with that, the SBG token will be used as payment means in every transaction related to properties owned by the Fund to ensure safety, security, and transparency.",

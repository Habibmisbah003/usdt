    "description": "The Creation Token (AMAN) is the native token of Crypto Ultraman. It allows its holders to freely create Crypto Ultraman works, which will be permanently stored and publicly visible on the BSC blockchain. Therefore, simplifying the creation itself makes IP more diversified and personalized in its development. This opens up a whole new dimension for NFT Ultraman, in which the value level of each piece of NFT in the entire market is strongly influenced by consumer preferences.",

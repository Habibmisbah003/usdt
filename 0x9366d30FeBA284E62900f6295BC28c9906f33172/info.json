    "description": "The BioFi token is a Utility Token that addresses the concerns many people have about safeguarding their personal data while being safe from exploitation by fraudsters. With data breaches and hacks on the rise, consumers in the 21st century are losing faith in the ability of service providers to protect their identity and other sensitive information. BioFi helps solve this problem by bringing the speed, security, and anonymity of biometric identity to the blockchain and the DeFi space.",
